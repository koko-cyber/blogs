Every year, major movie festivals around the world present awards for Best Director. Some of these festivals began decades ago, and their lists of winners for Best Director awards are quite long. However, among all the names of winners, it's hard to find the names of female directors.

The Cannes International Film Festival was the first major movie festival to choose a female director as Best Director. In 1961, a female director called Yuliya Solntseva won it at Cannes. After that, other movies directed by female directors won the Golden Palm Award. But the female directors of these movies did not win the Best Director award at Cannes.

The Best Director award at the Berlin International Film Festival is called Silver Bear for Best Director. A woman has succeeded in winning it. She was Astrid Henning-Jensen from Denmark. Over her career, she directed more than 20 movies and in 1979, she won Silver Bear for Best Director for her movie Winterborn.

It is very difficult for female directors to win the Academy Award for Best Directing in the USA. In fact, since the Oscars began in 1929, only several women have ever been nominated for best directing. The first woman to actually win this award was Kathryn Bigelow for directing The Hurt Locker. She received the award in 2010.

Over the years, women have directed many wonderful movies. For example, Nora Ephron directed the romantic comedy Sleepless in Seattle, and Catherine Hardwicke directed the popular movie Twilight in 2008. Two very famous animated movies were directed by a woman-Vicky Jenson directed Shrek and Shark Tale.



世界各地的大型电影节每年都会须发最佳导演奖。其中一些电影节是几十年前开始的,它们的最佳导演奖的获奖者名单相当长。然而,在所有获奖者的名字中都难以找到女导演的名字。戛纳国际电影节是第一个把女导演选为最佳导演的大型电影节。在1961年,一位名叫朱丽娅·索恩泽娃的女导演在戛纳获得了最佳导演奖。在那之后,其他由女导演执导的电影获得过金棕桐奖。但这些电影的女导演没有在夏纳获得过最佳导演奖。柏林国际电影节的最佳导演奖被称为最佳导演银熊奖。一位女性成功获得了这个奖项。她是来自丹麦的阿斯特丽兹·亨宁-延森。在她的职业生涯中,她导演了20多部电影,并于1979年凭借其电影《冬天的孩子》获得最佳导演银熊奖。女导演很难获得美国的奥斯卡最佳导演奖。事实上,自1929年设立奥斯卡金像奖以来,只有几名女性被提名最佳导演。第一位真正获得这个奖项的女性是导演了《拆弹部队》的凯瑟琳·毕格罗。她在2010年获奖。多年来,女性导演了许多精彩的电影。例如,诺拉·艾芙隆导演了浪漫喜剧《西雅图夜未眠》,凯瑟琳哈德威克在2008年导演了《暮光之城》这部受欢迎的电影。两部非常著名的动画电影是由一位女性导演的--维姬·詹森导演了《怪物史菜克》和《鲨鱼故事》。
