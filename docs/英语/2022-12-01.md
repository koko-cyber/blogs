At the end of August, I moved from London to a small town in Quebec, Canada, called Matane, to work as an English language teaching assistant. Patience is a word that has **appeared** (出现) in **many forms** (多种形式) over the past two months.

I don't see myself as being the most patient person in the world, but there was something that shocked me during my first week of work. I had just finished a discussion with two students and as they were leaving the classroom, one of the students turned back and said, "Thank you for your patience. " That was an early reminder of the importance of being patient as a teacher. **Moreover** (此外), it helped me to realize the importance of showing patience in the class, for it can be the difference between building someone's confidence in **entirely** (完全地). Being patient as a teacher means understanding students.

	我认为自己不是世界上最有耐心的人,但在我工作的第一周,有一件事让我震惊。我刚和两个学生讨论完,而当他们要离开教室时,其中一个学生回过头来说道:“谢谢您的耐心。”那是一个早期的提醒,提醒我成为一名有耐心的老师的重要性。此外,它帮助我意识到在课堂上表现耐心的重要性,因为这会是建立一个人对(学好)一门语言的信心和彻底摧毁其信心之间的区别。作为老师,有耐心意味着理解学生

It is not easy to live my life constantly in French but the people of Quebec are very patient. They repeat saying several times and they are more than happy to wait while I find the correct words to express myself. It's a learning process but with the patience of others, the process is **slightly less terrifying** (稍微没那么可怕). Making mistakes shows you are trying and I think this is greatly **appreciated** (赏识) by Quebeckers.

When I first arrived in Matane, I had to **concentrate** (集中注意力) all the time due to the language and that gave me a headache. I had to keep reminding myself that it would take time. Now the headaches have been a **distant** (遥远的) memory and listening to French has become habitual for me in this **environment** (环境) filled with Quebeckers' accent. The key is to be patient with yourself. There is no short cut to learning a language, but the result will be worth the effort in the end.
