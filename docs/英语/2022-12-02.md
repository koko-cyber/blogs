Instead of being playthings, early kites were used for military purposes.  Historical records say they were large in size;  some were powerful enough to carry men up in the air to observe enemy movements, and others were used to scatter some information over hostile forces. 

During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), people began to fix on kites some bamboo (竹子) strips which, when high in the air, would ring in the wind like a zheng (a traditional Chinese musical instrument).  Since then, the popular Chinese name for the kite has become fengzheng.  The kites made today in some places are fixed with silk strings or rubber bands to give out pleasant ringing in the wind. 

It was also believed, for instance, during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), that flying a kite and then letting it go, apart from the pleasure in itself, might send off one's bad luck and illness.  Consequently it would bring him bad luck if one should pick up a kite lost by other people, This may be regarded as superstition (迷信) but may not be altogether without reason: think of the good it will do to a person, ill and depressed all the time, if he or she could go out into the fields and fresh air to fly a kite. 

Chinese kites fall into two major types: those with wings that can be taken apart and those with wings that are fixed.  The former can be taken apart and packed in boxes.  Easy to carry about, they make good presents.  The second type refers to those with fixed structure;  they fly better and higher, given a steady wind.  Classified by designs and other standards, there are no less than 300 varieties, including human figures, fish, insects, birds, animals and written Chinese characters.  In size, they range from 304 meters to only 30 centimeters across.

早期的风筝不是玩具，而是用于军事目的。历史记载说，它们的体型很大;有些无人机的威力足以载人到空中观察敌人的动向，有些则用来向敌方部队散布情报。

在唐代(618-907)，人们开始在风筝上固定一些竹条(竹子)，当它在空中时，会在风中像筝(一种中国传统乐器)一样响。从那时起，风筝的中国名字就变成了“风筝”。今天有些地方制作的风筝是用丝线或橡皮筋固定的，以便在风中发出悦耳的响声。

例如，在清朝(1644-1911)，人们还认为放风筝，然后放风筝，除了本身的乐趣之外，可能会送走一个人的坏运气和疾病。因此，如果一个人捡起别人丢失的风筝，他会带来坏运气。这可能被认为是迷信(迷信)，但也不是完全没有理由:想想对一个一直生病和抑郁的人来说，如果他或她可以到田野里和新鲜的空气中放风筝会有多好。

中国风筝主要有两种:一种是可以拆卸的翅膀，另一种是固定的翅膀。前者可以拆开装在盒子里。它们便于携带，是很好的礼物。第二类是指结构固定的;如果风稳定，它们飞得更好，飞得更高。按照图案和其他标准分类，有不少于300个品种，包括人物、鱼、虫、鸟、动物和汉字。它们的直径从304米到只有30厘米不等。
